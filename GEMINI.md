# Gemini Project Context: Personal Portfolio Website

## Project Overview

This directory contains a simple, static, single-page personal portfolio website. It is designed to be a clean and modern showcase for a software engineer named "John Doe".

The website is built using plain HTML and CSS. It features a professional design with the following sections:
*   A main header with the individual's name and title.
*   An "About Me" section with a profile picture and a descriptive paragraph.
*   A "My Projects" section laid out in a card-based grid.
*   A footer with copyright information.

The main technologies used are:
*   **HTML5:** For the structure and content.
*   **CSS3:** For styling, layout, and responsiveness.
*   **Google Fonts:** For typography (`Montserrat`).

## Building and Running

This is a static website and does not require a build process or a special server.

To view the website, simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

There are currently no automated tests for this project.

## Development Conventions

*   **Styling:** All custom styles are located in the `style.css` file. The styling aims for a modern, professional aesthetic with a clean layout and a simple color scheme.
*   **Structure:** The `index.html` file is well-structured using semantic HTML5 tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to organize content.
*   **Content:** The content in `index.html` is currently placeholder text. The profile image is `image.png`. To personalize the website, you should:
    1.  Replace the placeholder text in the "About Me" and "My Projects" sections with your own information.
    2.  Replace `image.png` with your own profile picture.
